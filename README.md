# Produce 404
Create your own K-pop girl group! A React app served by a Node.js backend with a REST API. Connects to a MongoDB database, the Spotify API, and the YouTube API.

This is my first ever full-sized web development project. I learned a lot along the way, but there is a lot I would improve on and fix if I were to make this again. It's a little messy, but the functionality's all there. I'm pretty proud of what I was able to create for my first web app.

## How to use
[Produce 404 can be found on Heroku.](https://produce404.herokuapp.com/)

If you want to launch the app locally, follow these steps.

1. `cd` to the `/pd404` directory
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm start`
4. open `http://localhost:8080/`
